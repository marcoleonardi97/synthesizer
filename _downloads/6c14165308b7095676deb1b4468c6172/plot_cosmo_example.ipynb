For\n# CAMELS-IllutrisTNG there is the `load_CAMELS_IllutrisTNG` method\n#\n# If your simulation does not have its own front end, please use the\n# templates in `synthesizer/load_data.py` to create your own.\ngals = load_CAMELS_IllustrisTNG(\n    \"../../tests/data/\",\n    snap_name=\"camels_snap.hdf5\",\n    group_name=\"camels_subhalo.hdf5\",\n)\n\nprint(f\"Loaded {len(gals)} galaxies\")\n\n# this creates `gals`, which is a list containing a `synthesizer.Galaxy`\n# object for each structure in the subfind file.

These components include `Stars`, `Gas\n# `, and `BlackHoles`.\n\n# Lets take a galaxy to work with\ng = gals[1]\n\n# Before we can generate any spectra we need to instantiate an emission model.\n# To begin with lets just use a premade incident model to get the\n# incident stellar spectra.\nincident = IncidentEmission(grid)\n\n# To get a spectra we just call the `get_spectra` method on the stars with\n# whatever emission model we want to use, here the incident model.\nspec = g.stars.get_spectra(incident)\n\n# Lets use the `stars.plot_spectra` method to plot this spectra.

This is\n# particularly the case for young star particles; a single massive\n# particle that happens to form close to the time of observation can\n# significantly alter the integrated colour of the entire galaxy.\n#\n# To mitigate this, we provide a method for smoothing the recent star\n# formation history of a particle galaxy by replacing each young star\n# particle with a parametric SFH. An example is provided [here](../sed.ipynb).\n#\n# This functionality can be enabled by setting the argument `parametric_\n# young_stars` on any `get_spectra_*` methods. This should be set to the\n# age at which you wish to smooth the SFH. The default form of the SFH is\n# constant, but this can also be modified by providing a parametric SFH\n# object to the `parametric_sfh` argument.\nparametric_spec = g.stars.get_spectra(\n    incident, parametric_young_stars=500 * Myr\n)\n\nplt.loglog(spec.lam, spec.lnu + spec.lnu, label=\"Particle\")\nplt.loglog(\n    parametric_spec.lam, parametric_spec.lnu, label=\"Parametric + Particle\"\n)\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\\\lambda \\\\,/\\\\, \\\\AA$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"$L_{\\\\nu} \\\\,/\\\\, \\\\mathrm{erg \\\\; s^{-1} \\\\; Hz^{-1}}$\")\nplt.ylim(10**22.0, 10**29.0)\nplt.xlim(10**2.0, 10**5.2)\nplt.show()\n\n\n# ## Nebular emission\n#\n# If our grid file has been post-processed with CLOUDY we can produce the\n# nebular emission for our camels galaxies. For this we need get a\n# NebularEmissionModel\nnebular = NebularEmission(grid)\n\n# And then, like before, we just hand this off to the `plot_spectra` method\nspec = g.stars.get_spectra(nebular)\nfig, ax = g.stars.plot_spectra(show=True)\n\n# With any of the spectra we've made so far we could also pass an escape\n# fraction (fesc) but specifically for nebular we will get extra line and\n# nebular emission if we pass a lyman alpha escape fraction.\nnebular = NebularEmission(grid, fesc_ly_alpha=0.2)\nspec = g.stars.get_spectra(nebular)\nfig, ax = g.stars.plot_spectra(show=True)\n\n# To get the gas reprocessed spectra, which\n# we refer to as the *reprocessed* spectra, assuming some escape fraction\n# `fesc`.\nreprocessed = ReprocessedEmission(\n    grid,\n    fesc=0.2,\n    fesc_ly_alpha=0.1,\n)\ng.stars.get_spectra(reprocessed)\n\n# The plots starting to get a bit messy now so let's select the spectra we\n# want to plot\nfig, ax = g.stars.plot_spectra(\n    show=True,\n    spectra_to_plot=(\"reprocessed\", \"incident\", \"nebular\"),\n)\n\n# ## Dust attenuation\n#\n# We can apply a range of different dust models to our reprocessed spectra. To\n# do so we can simply make an attenuated model and point it at our reprocessed\n# model. To do so we need a dust_curve, for more details on these see the\n# dust attenuation docs.\nattenuated = AttenuatedEmission(\n    grid=grid,\n    emitter=\"stellar\",\n    dust_curve=PowerLaw(slope=-1),\n    apply_dust_to=reprocessed,\n    tau_v=0.33,\n    component=\"stellar\",  # we can point models at different components\n)\nspec = g.stars.get_spectra(attenuated)\nfig, ax = g.stars.plot_spectra(\n    show=True,\n    spectra_to_plot=[\"reprocessed\", \"attenuated\"],\n)\n\n# Of course, in reality we won't be making individual models and calling\n# get_spectra with them 1 by 1. Instead we can make/use large models\n# which will generate all the spectra we want at once. For more details\n# on making your own models see the emisison models docs. Here we will\n# use a premade model that will produce spectra following Charlot&Fall2000\ncf_model = CharlotFall2000(\n    grid,\n    tau_v_ism=0.33,\n    tau_v_birth=0.67,\n    dust_curve_ism=PowerLaw(slope=-0.7),\n    dust_curve_birth=PowerLaw(slope=-1.3),\n    age_pivot=10 * dimensionless,\n)\nspec = g.stars.get_spectra(cf_model)\nfig, ax = g.stars.plot_spectra(show=True, figsize=(10, 6))\n\n\n# ### Multiple galaxies\n# If we want to create spectra for multiple galaxies and then interact with\n# a particular spectra from them all in a single Sed object we can use a list\n# comprehension. Here we grab the luminosity `lnu` of each galaxy into a\n# list, and combine into a single sed object afterwards using the grid\n# wavelength.\nspecs = np.vstack([g.stars.get_spectra(incident).lnu for g in gals])\nspecs = Sed(lam=grid.lam, lnu=specs)\n\n\n# Importantly here, we don't create an SED object for each galaxy spectra\n# . We instead create the 2D array of spectra, and then create an `Sed`\n# object for the whole collection.\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nax.loglog(grid.lam, specs.lnu.T)\nax.set_ylim(\n    1e22,\n)\nax.set_xlim(1e2, 2e4)\nax.set_xlabel(\"$\\\\lambda \\\\,/\\\\, \\\\AA$\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"$L_{\\\\nu} \\\\,/\\\\, \\\\mathrm{erg \\\\; s^{-1} \\\\; Hz^{-1}}$\")\n\n\n# ### Calculate broadband luminosities\n#\n# We can then use the `Sed` methods on the whole collection. This is much\n# faster than calling the method for each spectra individually, since we\n# can take advantage of vectorisation. For example, we can calculate UVJ\n# colours of all the selected galaxies in just a couple of lines.\n#\n# First get rest frame 'flux'\n\n\nspec.get_fnu0()\n\n\n# Define a filter collection object (UVJ default) and calculate the photometry.\n\n\nfc = UVJ(new_lam=grid.lam)\n\n_UVJ = spec.get_photo_fnu(fc)\nprint(_UVJ)\n_UVJ.plot_photometry(show=True)\n\n\n# Do for multiple, plot UVJ diagram, coloured by $M_{\\star}$\n\n\nmstar = np.log10(\n    np.array([np.sum(g.stars.initial_masses) for g in gals]) * 1e10\n)\n\n\nspecs.get_fnu0()\n_UVJ = specs.get_photo_fnu(fc)\n\nUV = _UVJ[\"U\"] / _UVJ[\"V\"]\nVJ = _UVJ[\"V\"] / _UVJ[\"J\"]\n\nplt.scatter(VJ, UV, c=mstar, s=40)\nplt.xlabel(\"VJ\")\nplt.ylabel(\"UV\")\nplt.colorbar(\n    label=r\"$\\mathrm{log_{10}} \\, M_{\\star} \\,/\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$\"\n)\n\n\n# ## Collective operations\n#\n# It is often useful to collectively do different operations on a `Galaxy\n# `. Synthesizer enables this via some wrapper methods on a galaxy which\n# will operate on it's components to, for instance, get the observed\n# spectra or photometry for all spectra nested in a `Galaxy`.\n\n# Get observed spectra for all spectra\ng.get_observed_spectra(cosmo=cosmo)\n\n# Get UVJ photometry for all spectra\ng.get_photo_lnu(fc)\ng.get_photo_fnu(fc)\n\nprint(\"Stellar luminosities available:\", list(g.stars.photo_lnu.keys()))\nprint(\"Stellar fluxes available:\", list(g.stars.photo_fnu.keys()))"
