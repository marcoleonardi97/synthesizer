Synthesizer is a python package for generating synthetic astrophysical observables. It is modular, flexible and fast.

Read the documentation [here](https://flaresimulations.github.io/synthesizer/).

## Getting Started

First clone the latest version of `synthesizer`

    git clone https://github.com/flaresimulations/synthesizer.git

To install, enter the `synthesizer` directory and install with pip.

    cd synthesizer
    pip install .

We also provide optional dependency sets for development (`dev`), testing (`test`), and building the documentation (`docs`) should you ever needed them. To install all dependancies simply run the following (or delete as appropriate to get a specific subset):

    pip install .[dev,test,docs]

Make sure you stay up to date with the latest versions through git:

    git pull origin main

### Getting test data

If you wish to run the examples, or need some data for development purposes, we provide [test data](https://flaresimulations.github.io/synthesizer/getting_started/downloading_grids.html#downloading-the-test-grid). This can be downloaded through the command line interface. Run the following at the root of the Synthesizer repo,

```bash
synthesizer-download --test-grids --dust-grid -d tests/test_grid
```

This command will store the SPS, AGN, and dust grids in the `tests` directory at the root of the repo; all examples expect this data to reside in this location.

You will also want to download the preprocessed CAMELS Illustris-TNG data,

```bash
synthesizer-download --camels-data -d tests/data/
```

this is a very small set of galaxies taken from the [CAMELS suite](https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of simulations. We use this in some particle based examples.
